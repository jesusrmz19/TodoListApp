# Todo app

Todo App being created for personal use.
This App will use local storage and firebase to maintain the tasks and save states
You will be able to use local storage to save a local todo list
But if you had an access, the todolist could be use on different devices once you log-in

## Updates

Currently I'm rebuilding the app architecture based on the MVC (Model-View-Controller) Architecture
Having some issues with saving the checked state 🐞

Testing website doesn't have the latest code at the moment

### Using

- JavaScript
- HTML
- SCSS
- Parcel
- Firebase
